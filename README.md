# 🚫 Cyberbullying Tweet Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify tweets based on the type of cyberbullying they contain. It aims to help in identifying and categorizing harmful online behavior to support moderation efforts and create safer digital spaces.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a classification model that predicts the **type of cyberbullying** from a given tweet. The categories are:

- Age
- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Religion
- Not Cyberbullying
- Other Cyberbullying


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- NLTK / re (for text preprocessing)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)

## ⚙️ Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Text cleaning (removing URLs, punctuation, etc.)
   - Tokenization and stopword removal
   - Label encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizations for class distribution
   - Word clouds for each class

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

4. **Model Building**
   - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Train-test split
   - Model training and evaluation

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ✅ Results

- **Model Used**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~78%
- The model performs well in distinguishing between cyberbullying types.
