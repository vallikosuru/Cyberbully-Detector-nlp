# 🚫 cyberbully-detector-nlp

A machine learning project that detects and classifies cyberbullying in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.


## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a classification model that predicts the **type of cyberbullying** from a given tweet. The categories are:

- Age
- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Religion
- Not Cyberbullying
- Other Cyberbullying


## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- NLTK / re (for text preprocessing)
- Scikit-learn (for model building)

## ⚙️ Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Text cleaning (removing URLs, punctuation, etc.)
   - Tokenization and stopword removal
   - Label encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizations for class distribution
   - Word clouds for each class

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization

4. **Model Building**
   - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Train-test split
   - Model training and evaluation

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## ✅ Results

- **Model Used**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~78%
- The model performs well in distinguishing between cyberbullying types.
